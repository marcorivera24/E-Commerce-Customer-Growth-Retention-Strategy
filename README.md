# E-Commerce-Customer-Growth-Retention-Strategy


Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world transactional data from an online retail company to uncover customer behavior patterns and generate actionable business insights.

Using customer-level aggregation and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, the project segments customers based on purchasing behavior and evaluates their revenue contribution to identify growth and retention opportunities.

The objective is to transform raw transaction data into strategic recommendations that support customer lifetime value optimization and revenue growth.
